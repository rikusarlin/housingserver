# housingserver
Spring Boot Rest service, with validations done using Spring Validation and ORM stuff done with Spring Data repository backed by H2 database. The actual Rest service is generated by openapi-generator from an OpenApi 3.0 specification. We just implement the business logic here.

## Domain model
The application domain is an imaginary "housing benefit application" containing various pieces of information. Date periods and of money of many are prominent features in this domain model. The business objects are as follows
* Housing benefit case
    * id
    * case state
    * Customer
            * id
            * person number
            * date of birth
            * first name
            * last name    
    * Housing benefit application
        * id
        * date range of application
        * timestamp when received
        * Applicant
            * id
            * person number
            * date of birth
            * first name

            * first name
            * last name
    * List of incomes
        * id
        * income type
        * description, if type of income is "other income"
        * amount
        * date range
    * List of housing expenses
        * id
        * expense type
        * description, if type of expense is "other expense"
        * amount

## Usage
The service is accessed via Rest api. Swagger UI is included in the package in the following address 
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html

### Housing benefit case
* GET /api/v1/housing/cases - fetch all housing benefit cases
* GET /api/v1/housing/cases/{personNumber} - fetch all housing benefit cases where a person given is a member of household
* GET /api/v1/housing/{caseId} - fetch one housing benefit case
* PUT /api/v1/housing - add housing benefit case
* POST /api/v1/housing - update (or add) housing benefit application in a case
* GET /api/v1/housing/{caseId}/check - cross validate housing benefit application

### Persons
These are considered to be stored in a separate database, reflected in the fact they are accessed through api in another "context root", and not needing a case id
* GET /api/v1/housing/persons - fetch all persons
* GET /api/v1/housing/person/{id} - fetch one person
* PUT /api/v1/housing/person - add person
* POST /api/v1/housing/person/{id} - update (or add) person
* GET /api/v1/housing/person/{id}/check - cross validate person
 
### Household member
* GET /api/v1/housing/{caseId}/householdmembers - fetch all household members of a case
* GET /api/v1/housing/{caseId}/householdmember/{id} - fetch one household member of a case
* PUT /api/v1/housing/{caseId}/householdmember - add household member to a case, a Household member containing a Person needs to be in payload
* POST /api/v1/housing/{caseId}/householdmember/{id} - update (or add) household member in a case
* GET /api/v1/housing/{caseId}/householdmember/{id}/check - cross validate household member

### Expense
* GET /api/v1/housing/{caseId}/expenses - fetch all expenses of a case
* GET /api/v1/housing/{caseId}/expense/{id} - fetch one expense
* PUT /api/v1/housing/{caseId}/expense - add expense to a case
* POST /api/v1/housing/{caseId}/expense/{id} - update (or add) expense in a case
* GET /api/v1/housing/{caseId}/expense/{id}/check - cross validate expense

### Income
* GET /api/v1/housing/{caseId}/incomes - fetch all incomes of a case
* GET /api/v1/housing/{caseId}/income/{id} - fetch one income
* PUT /api/v1/housing/{caseId}/income - add income to a case
* POST /api/v1/housing/{caseId}/income/{id} - update (or add) income in a case
* GET /api/v1/housing/{caseId}/income/{id}/check - cross validate income

### Housing benefit application
* GET /api/v1/housing/{caseId}/application - fetch all housing benefit applications
* GET /api/v1/case/{personNumber} - fetch all housing benefit applications of a person
* GET /api/v1/housing/{caseId} - fetch one housing benefit application

* GET /api/v1/housing/{caseId}/check - cross validate housing benefit application
 
 In addition to the actual Rest service, there are experiments with JSON schema based validation in class JsonSchemaValidition application (in src/test/main). JSON schema files can be found in src/main/resources and some example JSON input in src/test/resources. JsonSchemaValidation app also shows how to combine JSON schema validation to Spring validation (in a rather unsatisfactory way, though). This could also be applied to Rest service, see [this blog post](https://www.mscharhag.com/spring/json-schema-validation-handlermethodargumentresolver). All in all, only quite basic validation can be done through JSON schema validation - no cross-validation can be done, and no validation containing complex logic (such as validating control characters).
